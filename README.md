## Beer E-Commerce Challenge README

Welcome to the Beer E-Commerce Challenge repository! This project is a solution to a challenge aimed at building a beer e-commerce platform with real-time updates for stock and price information.

### Overview

In this challenge, i built a mockup for a E-Commerce App with a Home, Cart, Settings and Product Detail Page (PDP) that displays detailed information about a single product. The PDP updates stock and price information every 5 seconds, utilizing an API endpoint for retrieving product data.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nicolaspineyro/beer-e-commerce-challenge.git

2. Navigate to the Project Directory and Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   yarn install
   cd ../backend
   yarn install

3. Run the project
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   yarn dev
   cd ../backend
   yarn dev

4. Review the Port Configuration:

If both servers are running without any issues, you should be able to access the frontend at http://localhost:5173 and the backend at http://localhost:3000.
In case of any port conflicts or if you need to change the default ports, you can review and adjust the port configurations in the respective package.json files or server configuration files.
